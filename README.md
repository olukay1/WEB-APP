# GLANCE-IT

This is project is for movie lovers who finds it stressful going through all movie reviews before streaming or downloading movie of choice.
The app visualise reviews of any title queried by user. It uses IMDB internal search engine to lookup query (title) entered by user.
The app then returns pie chart of movie rating and bar chart of movie sentiment.

I'm still working on adding new features to the app...
